Project: Sonar Mine Detection

Description:

This Python code implements a Logistic Regression model to classify sonar readings as either indicating a rock (R) or a mine (M) based on a dataset of sonar measurements. It performs the following steps:

Imports Necessary Libraries:

numpy: Used for numerical computations and array manipulation.
pandas: Used for data analysis and loading data from CSV files.
sklearn.linear_model: Provides the LogisticRegression class for building the model.
sklearn.model_selection: Used for splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Loads the Sonar Data:

Reads the sonar data from a CSV file named "sonar data.csv" (assuming it's located in the /content directory).
Prints the first few rows of the data using sonar_data.head().
Data Exploration:

Analyzes the data using sonar_data.describe(): This provides summary statistics like mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for each feature (column).
Explores the target variable (class labels) using sonar_data[60].value_counts(): This shows the distribution of "R" and "M" labels.
Analyzes group-wise means using sonar_data.groupby(60).mean(): This might reveal differences in the average values of features between rocks and mines.
Data Preparation:

Splits the data into features (X) and target variable (Y):
X contains all columns except the last one (60th column), which is assumed to be the target variable.
Y is the last column (60th) containing the class labels ("R" or "M").
Splits the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split:
X_train and Y_train represent the training data used to build the model.
X_test and Y_test represent the testing data used to evaluate the model's performance.
The test size is set to 10% using test_size=0.1.
random_state=1 ensures reproducibility of the split by setting a seed for the random number generator.
Model Training:

Creates a Logistic Regression model using LogisticRegression().
Trains the model on the training data (X_train, Y_train) using model.fit().
Model Testing:

Prepares a new data point (represented by the int_data tuple) that needs classification.
Converts int_data to a NumPy array using np.asarray(int_data).
Reshapes the array into a single row with multiple columns using reshape(1, -1). This is necessary because the model expects a 2D array as input.
Makes a prediction on the new data point using model.predict().
Based on the prediction ("M" for mine, "R" for rock), prints a message indicating whether a mine or rock has been discovered.
Note:

This code assumes the data is already prepared in the CSV file.
The actual performance of the model might need further evaluation (e.g., using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
You might need to adjust the code based on your specific data format and requirements.
